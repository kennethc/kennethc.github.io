I start my journey to write about my thoughts and learnings on Life, the Universe, and Everthing.

There are many sites on which to host my posts, but using Jekyll on GitHub Pages seems a reasonable choice. Posts are version controlled. Jekyll is relatively easy to set up. Markdown is a very lightweight markup language. All this means I can focus on writing instead of running a site.

So let me properly start by saying I've been learning Golang. I started my learning journey on C. I loved C, but my path has me dealing mostly with dynamically typed languages like PHP and Ruby. I have been wanting to learn a new language, and the stars have aligned for me. Choosing Go makes sense for me as I wanted to learn a statically typed language, and it's also gaining popularity very quickly. The timing is also very good as I have joined a mentorship programme as a mentor, and this will allow me to run through the same learning roadmap as our proteges and test the roadmap. Hopefully my musings here may also be useful for my readers.

Go is a very nice language so far. It is pretty straightforward if you are familiar with C-type syntax. The [Go Documentation][go-doc] is a very good starting point for anyone learning Go. I can definitely recommend starting with [How to write Go code][go-code], then moving on to [A Tour of Go][go-tour], before exploring the other topics at your own leisure.

The [Package Documentation][go-pkg] is pretty good. Although sometimes I wish the layout can be a bit better. Links can feel a bit too cluttered at times, and the page sections can be a bit hard to distinguish.

I will end my first post here, but more will be posted as I reflect on my journey with Go.
