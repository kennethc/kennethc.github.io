Over a prolonged lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've wanted to be able to make better coffee at home. At the start, I have made do with instant coffee, but eventually I graduated to a moka pot, which I already have. It was fine for a while, but then I started yearning for the true espresso experience.

# The Equipment
There are quite a lot of options available for home-based espresso machines, but most of them are really quite expensive and bulky. I wanted something that is affordable, does not compromise on espresso quality, and easy to maintain. This led me to:
- Flair Espresso Classic
- Baratza Sette 30 grinder
- Bodum Barista coffee scale

## Flair Espresso Classic
This is a fully manual, non-electric lever espresso machine. It comes with a bottomless portafilter and a spout attachment, but for maximum learning, you will really want to leave the spout attachment off. The Flair provides a unique tactile feedback when pulling an espresso shot that other electric machines won't give you. This, along with the visual feedback that you get with a bottomless portafilter, gives the user a lot of data to assist with learning and understanding espresso.

## Baratza Sette 30
This grinder has a straight-through design with very low grind retention. It lends well to both single-dosing (only filling the bean hopper with enough for a single dose of espresso) and time-based grinding with a hopper full of beans. The grind quality is good enough and it is also much more affordable than many of the other espresso-focussed grinders. It only has stepped grind size adjustment, which isn't a huge problem for me just yet, but also has an Adjustment Assembly part that I can buy and swap out should I want continous grind size adjustment.

## Bodum Barista coffee scale
This is an affordable scale that goes down to 0.1g precision for the espresso weight range. It's not as thin or small as other coffee scales and it has some minor quirks when weighing, but it also doesn't cost hundreds of dollars. What more can I say?

# A Beginner's Perspective
I bought my setup knowing full well that everything is going to be manual, and it will be up to me to learn how to make good espresso. So I spent a lot of time reading and watching, learning about how to make espresso and what techniques I can use to influence my shot. However, a lot of the information I've come across are quite fragmented and do not go into a lot of detail about why something is done a certain way and what happens if it's not followed.

Many of the YouTube videos or articles out there will make it look like an easy task. It's not - at least not initially. There are a lot of variables that a beginner will need to learn to achieve consistent and repeatable results. Many of the resources I have come across do not provide a systematic way of learning about the basics of espresso. Many people will be all too happy to go into all the minutia of making an espresso. Ignore them for now as they won't help you understand the basics. Many people will also be very happy to give you a set of numbers or recipes that you should follow to make good espresso. Treat these numbers as guidelines, not rules as they are not conducive to learning why certain things should be done a certain way. Later on, I will write about how hitting these numbers don't necessarily mean that you will produce a good espresso.

So then, what should one pay attention to? _Taste_. Taste is the primary informer of whether anything needs tweaking to influence the direction of your next shot. If you pulled a very tasty shot of espresso, what does it matter if you did not pull the shot with the water at precisely 92.5 degress Celsius, and your shot did not come out in precisely 28 seconds?

Unfortunately, taste is also one of the most subjective and least transferable attributes on which to base your outcome. In general, we will be trying to manage sourness (often associated with under-extraction) on one end, and bitterness (often associated with over-extraction) on the other end. Somewhere in the middle should be balance - not the elimination of sourness and bitterness, but a balance of flavours.

# A Systematic Way to Learn and Understand Espresso
I can only write from my own experience, but I hope what follows will help you, the reader, better understand the basic moving parts of making espresso. This next section will go through the process of making an espresso step by step, and we will discover how each step influences the outcome.

## Dosing the Coffee
One of the very first steps of making espresso is deciding how much coffee to use. Generally speaking, every portafilter basket would have an acceptable weight range that is printed either on the basket itself or in a manual. I would suggest aiming for the middle value and keeping it consistent. If your basket does not come with a published weight range for coffee, you will just need to make sure that your portalfilter can fit under the group head and the coffee isn't touching the dispersion screen. The dose can be adjusted to influence the outcome of the espresso, but I don't have too much experience in tweaking the dose and it changes 2 variables instead of 1 (resistance and amount of coffee needed to be extracted). I would make this one of the last variables to tweak when the user can produce consistent results.

## Grind Size Adjustment
Assuming that whole beans are used, we will want to turn these whole beans into ground coffee. How do we know when we have landed in the ballpark of the grind range required for espresso?

When the coffee is ground too coarsely, the coffee puck will not provide enough resistance to the water being forced through it. On a manual lever machine, you might struggle to get up to the 6-9 bar range for espresso. You will also find that water flows through the puck very quickly and more often than not, you will notice spurting on a bottomless portafilter from channelling no matter how well you think you have prepared the coffee bed. This type of channelling happens because the puck doesn't provide enough resistance to the water, and under pressure, the water is able to punch a hole (or channel) through the puck.

When the coffee is ground too finely, water would drip through the puck very slowly, even at 9 bars of pressure. At some extremes, water might not even come out of the puck at all.

Somewhere in between these 2 extremes should be a setting where the flow of coffee through the puck appears reasonable.

## Preparing the Coffee Bed
This step does not receive as much attention as it really should. When the coffee is ground and put into the basket, you do not want to just tamp it straightaway. When making espresso (or any other style of coffee for that matter), we want even extraction throughout the coffee puck and this means the coffee puck's density should be even throughout. If there are regions of lower density in the puck, then it is likely that more water will flow through that region causing uneven extraction. A small difference here can have a huge impact on the outcome of the shot.

I grind my coffee straight into the Flair Classic portafilter with the dosing funnel on. What I do to try and achieve puck evenness is to:
1. Tap the portafilter on the work surface a few times to settle the grind as the Baratza Sette 30 does produce very fluffy grinds. Some may find this step redundant but it works for me.
2. Use a toothpick to rake the surface of the coffee bed in a circular motion. As the coffee falls from the grinder, it tends to form a mound in the portafilter. This step will redistribute the coffee across the whole portafilter so the surface will become even. Some may know this as the Weiss Distribution Technique (WDT).
3. Tap the portafilter on the work surface again to settle the grind further. During this step, I will aim to have the coffee level stay under the top of the portalfilter so I can remove the dosing funnel.
4. Remove the dosing funnel and tamp.

At first, I did not use the WDT. I would only tap the portafilter until the grind falls below the top of the portafilter. Then I would remove the dosing funnel and tamp. While I did notice a small mound before tamping, it really wasn't very significant and I thought it wouldn't have made much difference. However, what I have learnt since is that even a small amount of surface unevenness can cause huge inconsistencies.

This was a time when I was struggling to repeat a good shot, and this was a time when I thought I was tasting over-extraction as sourness. I had been following the generally suggested extraction ratio of 1:2 (15g of coffee grind in, 30g of coffee liquid out) and had been extracting the coffee within the generally recommended time of 25-30 seconds. I also knew that if I clicked 1 step finer on my grinder, the machine would choke up and not produce enough coffee. So I knew what I had was as fine as I could go. I had been tasting a strong and sharp sourness in my coffee at this setting, but if I go 1 step coarser on my grinder, I would still taste sourness but it didn't have a sharp sensation. So one day I decided to reduce my extraction ratio by reducing the amount of liquid I yielded, and the sourness became less intense. I would reduce the yield again and generally the coffee would come out less sharp, which made me think that I was tasting over-extraction as a sharp and intense sourness because the general principle is that less yield means less extraction when all else being equal.

While reducing the yield has made the coffee somewhat better, the sourness never really went away and I continued to struggle with reproducing a shot. I have gone as low as 15g in 22g out, and sometimes it would taste alright, but a lot of the times the coffee would still be sour. As I felt like I have run out of room to adjust my shot, I started to look for other potential solutions.

As luck would have it, I had been paying attention to some of the other details like how the puck looked like when I removed the portafilter from the Flair Classic's brewing chamber. I have long noticed that the puck had a concave shape - lower in the middle and higher at the edges. At first, I thought this was just the coffee expanding to fill the headspace between the puck and the dispersion screen as it does not cover the whole surface and has a similar shape. Then, I would touch the puck and would feel that the raised edges in the puck were softer than the middle. I would let this information sit for some time before finally making the connection and hypothesised that the mound in the coffee causes increased density in the middle and reduced density in the outer edges after tamping - even if the surface was flat. This, in turn, could mean that the outer edges can become raised when the coffee expanded after extraction or when a vaccuum was formed when disconnecting the portafilter from the brew chamber.

It was at this time that I started experimenting with the WDT as I needed a way to distribute the coffee evenly throughout the whole surface of the portafilter. When I have distributed the coffee evenly, the puck actually came out flat after extraction. This was how I knew that the coffee wasn't expanding to fill in the gap and mold to the shape of the dispersion screen. This was also when I started gaining consistency. As long as I distribute the grind evenly, and I make a single change in my process, I could taste a difference, and more importantly, if I repeat the same process, I could get more or less the same result. _Consistency is the most important technical skill one can obtain when making espresso._ If you made a good shot, you need to be able to reproduce it, otherwise it is just a happy accident.

## Tamping
A lot has been said about tamping by other people, and I don't have any specific insights into this part. I try to make sure that I apply even pressure and push until I don't feel any more movement. Then I would remove the tamper straight up without any twisting motion.

## Water Temperature
What I did not tell you at the start was that I actually started the process by putting a kettle of water on first. I would then pour the boiling water out to pre-heat the brew chamber and the cup. When everything is assembled and I am ready to extract the coffee, I would bring the water up to boiling temperature again before pouring into the brew chamber. I have measured the temperature of the water inside the brew chamber once, and it was around 90 degrees Celsius. The water temperature is not something I would experiment with at this stage as I think there are other variables I can adjust more easily.

## The Extraction
I don't have any specific insights into this part, but this is the process that I follow:
1. Pre-infuse at 1 bar for 10 seconds, maintaining 1 bar of pressure throughout.
2. Ramp up the pressure to 9 bars and hold until the desired yield is achieved.

As the Flair machines provide an additional tactile feedback that electric machines don't, sometimes I would feel that the coffee was flowing too fast at 9 bars and I would reduce pressure to try and "save" the shot. This hasn't generally worked out great and I wouldn't call any of these shots good, but I also couldn't tell you if the shot would have been worse had I not tried to compensate. There are also advanced pressure profiling techniques that can be employed here but again I wouldn't be delving into them at this stage.

## The Coffee Yield
By now, there should be some amount of coffee liquid in a cup. The general starting point for how much liquid should be in a cup is a ratio of 1:2 by weight. In my case, I use 15g of coffee so I am aiming to have 30g of liquid in my cup. However, earlier I said taste is the primary informer of whether I should change something in my process. The 1:2 ratio does not necessarily guarantee a good cup of coffee, and if this is your first time pulling a shot, chances are you're not going to pull a good shot. Before we start changing up our process to try and make a better tasting espresso (what many would call the dialing in process), we need to establish if we have achieved consistency. Without consistency, we might change 1 variable, and on the off chance it may make a difference, but if we couldn't achieve the same result when we repeat the process then the change really isn't informing us of anything.

A couple of questions to ask when evaluating consistency:
1. If I pull a shot by following the same process exactly the way I did it before, will I get the same result?
2. If I pull a shot tomorrow, by following the same process exactly the way I did it today, will I get the same result?

My biggest struggle with consistency at the moment is with the WDT. It is by far the most manual and random part in the whole process, but it is also a whole lot better than making espresso without WDT. Most of the time I do get consistency, but every once in a while the technique would fail me. There are tools available to make distributing coffee a more consistent exercise, but none are as affordable and as readily available than a toothpick.

## Dialing In Espresso
By now, consistency should be achievable, and we can properly talk about the variables that we can tweak to dial in an espresso and achieve balance (as all things should be). This post is really dragging on by now, so I will give you my ranking of what to change first based on my own experience:
1. Grind size. Aim to get in the ballpark first. If you have a continually adjustable grinder, you can keep adjusting the grind size until you achieve your desired outcome. If you have a stepped grind size adjustment, or if your grinder retains a lot of coffee and you don't want to flush and waste coffee in between adjustments, just get close.
2. Yield. 1:2 is a good starting point, and you can run less water through to get less extraction or more water for more extraction.
3. Pressure. Higher pressure should mean faster flow rate and less extraction; lower pressure should mean slower flow rate and more extraction. Some would probably prefer adjusting water temperature before pressure, but for my setup, it is easier to control pressure.
4. Water temperature. From what I understand, higher temperature should mean more extraction and vice versa.
5. Dose. Tweak this last, because dose actually affects 2 aspects of the process: puck resistance and amount of coffee to extract.

If you have read this far, I thank you and I hope my post has provided some level of educational or entertainment value.
